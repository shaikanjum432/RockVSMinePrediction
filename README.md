# Sonar Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether objects detected by sonar are mines or rocks. The prediction is based on analyzing sonar data using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction
The project utilizes Python programming language and Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based system for writing Python scripts. With the aid of sonar technology, sound signals are sent and received to differentiate between mines and rocks.

## Workflow

**1. Data Collection:** Sonar data is collected through simulated experiments, where signals bounce back from metal cylinders (representing mines) and rocks.

**2. Data Pre-processing:** Collected data undergoes pre-processing steps to make it usable. This involves analyzing and understanding the data.

**3. Data Splitting:** The data is split into training and test sets to train the machine learning model and evaluate its performance.

**4. Model Selection:** Logistic regression is chosen as the model due to its effectiveness in binary classification problems.

**5. Model Training:** The selected model is trained using the training data to learn patterns and characteristics of metal cylinders and rocks.

**6. Prediction:** Once trained, the model can predict whether a new object detected by the sonar is a rock or a mine.
